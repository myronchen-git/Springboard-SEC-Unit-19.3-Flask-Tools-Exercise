# Survey

A simple survey application that will allow users to select a survey, store user responses, and display responses at the end of a survey. 
It allows users to go back to previous questions, while preventing users from visiting future or invalid ones.
Responses are saved into a cookie, so if a user quits and returns, the application will go back to the last question visited or the "thank you" page at the end.
